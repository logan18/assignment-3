	<h2>
	<strong>21 Items</strong> To Get <em>You</em> Through Your <strong>Twenties</strong></h2>
	
	<p>   Much like furnishing a new home, building a solid wardrobe once you’re in the real world can be both daunting and costly. Shopping for fun, trendy pieces versus saving and investing in classic items is a debate many of us struggle with, whether we’re new to receiving a paycheck or not. We constantly find ourselves with a growing pile of impulse purchases that we <strong>barely wear</strong>. Meanwhile, day after day, event after event, we expectantly return to the few quality items that always look classic and have been shown to stand the test of time. So <strong><em>which are these items are worth saving for?</em></strong> Well, with the help of <em>Bradley Agather</em>, author of style blog <em><strong>Luella and June</strong></em>, we’ve curated a list of 21 items every woman should have to get through her twenties. And because we know the economy is what it is, we’ve included a super budget-friendly item to get you by, as well as a more quality (read: costly) investment suggestion.</p>
	
	<h2><strong> Fashion Essentials for The Everygirl:</strong></h2>
	
	<h2><em>The Shoes</em></h2>
	
	<ul>

		<li>Ballet Flats: When heels simply won’t do, ballet flats are a must. They pair easily with just about anything. Not to mention, they’re as comfortable as they are chic!		</li>

		<li>Strappy Sandals: It’s impossible to get through summer without a pair of these. A classic leather pair will always be in style.</li>

		<li>Black Heels: A good pair of black heels will last you a lifetime. Whether you’re headed to the office or out for cocktails, black heels are a must-have!</li>

		<li>Running Shoes: These should be comfortable and provide great support whether you’re at the gym, hiking outdoors, or exploring a new city.</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<h2><em>The Clothes</em></h2>
	
	<ul>

		<li>A Striped Tee: When it comes to Ts, a striped one is a must-have. It’s easy to wear, casual, and oh, so versatile! Throw it on with a pair of denim and ballet flats for a classic look, or go bold and mix it with a printed pant.</li>

		<li>Cardigan: Whether you’re trying to stay warm or you just need a good layering piece, a cardigan is a wardrobe staple. Pair it with a fitted pencil skirt for the office, or, for the weekend, button it up over a classic white tee and jeans.</li>

		<li>Tailored Blazer: Every closet should have a tailored jacket that can be worn with jeans or over a cocktail dress. To keep it feminine, be sure the silhouette is fitted.</li>

		<li>Skinny Jeans: They go with everything. Enough said. Be sure to find a pair that fits you to a T.</li>

		<li>Little Black Dress: Is there anything more classic than the LBD? The key here is to keep it simple. Add a statement jewelry piece and you’re good to go.</li>

		<li>A Dress That’s Just for Fun: Once you’ve got your classic LBD, pick up a dress that’s just for fun. Something that at first glance might not seem totally practical, but it’s worth every penny because you feel good in it!</li>

		<li>Tailored Skirt: Interviews, meetings, or dinner parties: a tailored skirt is the perfect staple for looking both dressed up and sophisticated.</li>

		<li>Cold-Weather Coat: Even if you don’t live in a cold climate, who’s to say you won’t visit New York City, the Rocky Mountains, or perhaps more realistically, your relatives in Iowa over the holidays? It’s better to be prepared.</li>

		<li>A Bra for You: Finding the right bra can be quite tricky. Start by getting yourself measured to find the correct size, and then choose a bra that’s comfortable and will work underneath a variety of different style tops.</li>

		<li>A Bra for that Special Someone: Have some fun with this one! Lace? Neon? Whatever makes you feel the best!</li>

		<li>No-Show Underwear: Sometimes even thongs won’t do the trick. For those lightweight fabrics and form fitting pieces, seamless panties are key. You’ll be surprised how often you’ll reach for a pair of these.</li>

	</ul>
	
	<h2> <em>The Accessories</em></h2>
	
	<ul>
	
		<li>Leather Handbag: A leather handbag will last for years to come. It’s functional and chic. A medium-to-large size is ideal so that a girl-on-the-go can easily fit her iPad, iPhone, and all other daily essentials in here.</li>

		<li>Clutch: Whether you’re headed to a cocktail party or a date-night at the movies, the clutch is the easiest way to dress up any look.</li>

		<li>Weekender Bag: For those weekend getaways where a tote is just too small and your heavy-duty suitcase is too big.</li>

		<li>Sunglasses: No matter if you’re a Jackie O. or an Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffanys, pick a shape and style that makes you feel like a star. (Not to mention, a good pair is essential for hiding those tired eyes!) </li>

		<li>Understated Jewelry: Your essential accessory. The piece you wear from morning until bed time. You feel naked without it. Whether it’s a pair of earrings, your grandmother’s necklace, or a vintage ring, keep this one piece classic and simple. </li>

		<li>Watch: You know what they say: punctuality is a virtue. A good watch will keep you on time, and it’s an excellent layering piece between piles of gold bangles.</li>
